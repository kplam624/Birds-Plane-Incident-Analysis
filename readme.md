## Goal: Create awareness of the issue of birds striking airplanes and identify important factors related to this occurrence

Our team looked for trends and risks associated with bird strikes over a 15 year period (1990-2015) in the U.S. (states and terrritories) and Canada.

* See our powerpoint presentation for interesting analysis: "Project-1_CombatWombats.pptx"

* All of the images, plots and charts are saved in the "Output" and "Output_data" files

* Methodology for cleaning the database at the beginning of the projects is in "Cleaned_Database_Code.ipynb" and the data is saved as a .csv file in the "Resources" folder (Cleaned_data.csv)

* Individual analysis questions are examined in other jupyter notebooks
